## Intro

Inspired by [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM) video on Simulating Natural Selection.

Genetic algorithm visualized. Creatures survive and replicate by eating food or other creatures if they are more powerful enough. Each of DNA parameter has exponential power consumption as a drawback. Larger creatures store more energy, but also consume more. Speed consumes more energy in correlation to size.

DNA consists of:
- Speed
- Size
- Claws (attack)
- Shell (defence)
